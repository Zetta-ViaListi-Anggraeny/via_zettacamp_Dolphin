## TASK ##
1. *Create Project with Scenario* : 
    Book Inventory that allows users to manage a list of Books. This application will encompass Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. You'll use HTML, JavaScript, and Local Storage to build the system.
2. *Requirement for this project* : 
    - Display the complete *book details*, including name, total count, author, and description, in a structured Book Table.

    - Enhance the user interface with creative *CSS styling* for a visually appealing experience.

    - Incorporate an *"Edit Book"* button within each table row. Upon clicking, this button will activate a form input within the same row, pre-populated with the existing data.

    - Implement a *"Save"* button within rows while in "Edit" Mode. Users can utilize this button to update the data in local storage, reflecting the user-made changes.

    - Integrate a *"Delete Book"* button within each table row, visible only when not in "Edit" mode. Clicking this button will promptly eliminate the selected row's data, concurrently updating the information in local storage.

    - Introduce an *"Add Book"* button, allowing users to seamlessly append a new book entry to the table. Triggering this button will reveal a data input form, complete with a corresponding "Save" button â€“ mirroring the functionality of the "Edit" Mode.
