				<p>
					In the beginning, Baseballism was a youth baseball camp founded by four former college baseball players and teammates with a passion to teach the game the
					right way. The camp ran strong for two years and focused on the fundamentals of the game as well as the life lessons learned on the diamond. After two years of camp the founders went their separate ways; one became a teacher, one a military lawyer, one a sports sales rep and one a finance
					manager. Five years later the former teammates restored Baseballism as a premium off the field brand focusing on the class, tradition and history of
					baseball.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now in a different industry, the roots of the original Baseballism Youth Camp and passion for the game are present in every garment and accessory. A brand
					built for love of the game.
